## üéØ Perfect Bug Report Example

```
Bug: Flip animation not working

Expected: When I place a piece, the tile should rotate 
with a 0.6s animation showing the flip from empty to placed piece.

Actual: Piece just appears instantly, no animation.

Steps:
1. Start new game
2. Click any valid move (turquoise indicator)
3. Piece appears but no flip animation plays

Technical notes:
- Animation is defined in Tile.css (.tile-flip class)
- tile-flip class may not be added to element
- Or animation might be overridden by another CSS rule

Browser: Chrome 120
Device: MacBook Air, 1920x1080
```
