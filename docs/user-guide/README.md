## How to Play Othello

Othello (also known as Reversi) is a strategy board game for two players. The game is played on an 8x8 board with 64 discs that are black on one side and white on the other.

### Objective
The goal is to have more discs of your color than your opponent when the board is full or no more moves are possible.

### Rules

1. **Starting Position**: The game begins with four discs placed in the center of the board - two black and two white in a diagonal pattern.

2. **Making Moves**: Players take turns placing discs of their color. A valid move must:
   - Be placed on an empty square
   - Flank one or more of your opponent's discs between your new disc and another disc of your color
   - Cause at least one of your opponent's discs to be flipped to your color

3. **Flipping Discs**: When you place a disc that flanks your opponent's discs, all flanked discs are flipped to your color.

4. **Passing**: If a player has no valid moves, they must pass their turn.

5. **Game End**: The game ends when:
   - The board is completely filled, or
   - Neither player can make a valid move

### Controls

- **Click**: Click on any highlighted square to make your move
- **Sound**: Toggle sound effects using the volume controls
- **New Game**: Start a new game at any time

### Strategy Tips

1. **Corners are key**: Corner positions are the most valuable as they cannot be flanked.

2. **Avoid edges**: Edge positions (except corners) can be easily flanked.

3. **Mobility**: Keep multiple move options available.

4. **Stability**: Create positions that cannot be flipped later in the game.

5. **Endgame**: Count carefully in the final moves to maximize your score.
