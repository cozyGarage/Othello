## ⚙️ Configure GitHub Pages (One-Time Setup)

### Option 1: Use GitHub Actions (Recommended) ⭐

1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/cozyGarage/Othello
2. Click **Settings** → **Pages**
3. Under "Build and deployment":
   - Source: Select **"GitHub Actions"**
4. Save and done! ✅

**Benefits:**

- Better control
- See deployment status in Actions tab

### Option 2: Keep Current Setup (gh-pages branch)

If you already have gh-pages configured:
- Your current workflow will work
- But consider switching to GitHub Actions method

## 📊 What Happens on Each Push

```
Push to main
    ↓
GitHub Actions triggered
    ↓
1. Setup Bun environment
    ↓
2. Install dependencies (~5-10s)
    ↓
3. Run all tests (~1-2s)
    ↓
4. Build project (~3-5s)
    ↓
5. Deploy to GitHub Pages (~10-20s)
    ↓
Live at: https://cozygarage.github.io/Othello/
```

**Total time: ~30-40 seconds from push to live!** 🚀

## 🔍 Verify Everything Works

### 1. Check Workflows
```bash
# View in browser
open https://github.com/cozyGarage/Othello/actions
```

### 2. Check Test Badge Status
The badges in your README should now be active:
- ![Deploy Status](https://github.com/cozyGarage/Othello/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)
- ![Tests](https://github.com/cozyGarage/Othello/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)

### 3. Test Local Development
```bash
bun run dev    # Should work
bun test       # All tests should pass
bun run build  # Should build successfully
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate:
1. ✅ Watch the first deployment complete
2. ✅ Verify site is live at https://cozygarage.github.io/Othello/
3. ✅ Check that badges show green status

### Development Workflow:
```bash
# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature

# Make changes
# ... edit files ...

# Test locally
bun test
bun run dev

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"
git push origin feature/my-new-feature

# Create Pull Request on GitHub
# Tests will run automatically!

# After PR approval, merge to main
# Automatic deployment to production! 🚀
```

## 📚 Documentation

All documentation is in your repository:

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Deployment Fails:

1. **Check Actions tab** for error logs
2. **Common issues:**
   - GitHub Pages not enabled (see setup above)
   - Permissions not set (workflows already configured this)
   - Build errors (test locally first)

3. **Quick fixes:**
   ```bash
   # Test the build locally
   bun run build
   
   # If it fails, fix errors and push again
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix build errors"
   git push origin main
   ```

### If Tests Fail in CI:

1. **Run tests locally:**
   ```bash
   bun test
   ```

2. **Check for:**
   - Missing dependencies
   - Environment differences
   - Path issues

3. **View detailed logs** in GitHub Actions
